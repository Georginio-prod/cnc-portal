# CNC PORTAL
Often, several open-source developers coalesce around a particular project and that project that becomes a very successful company or foundation. Due to the nature of these open-source projects, however, there is no direct way to concretely recognize the innumerable micro contributions of each contributor along the way. Furthermore, large open projects often struggle to get contributors acting in unison in ways that are decisive, unified, and directed. The CNC Portal is to solve these two problems by 1) creating the mechanism to financially recognize micro contributions and, 2) creating tools that promote the emergence of effective governance.

The Crypto Native Corporation Portal (CNC Portal) has the potential to be an extremely large and extremely complex project.
